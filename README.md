# Healthcare_analytics_dashboard

## 🩺 Project Overview  
The **Healthcare Analytics Dashboard** provides actionable insights into patient visits, treatment costs, doctor performance, and lab test efficiency. This project demonstrates how healthcare data from MySQL can be transformed into interactive Power BI visuals to support data-driven decision-making for hospital management.  

---

## 🧩 Project Details  
- **Objective:** Build an interactive Power BI dashboard integrating data from MySQL to analyze key healthcare metrics.  
- **Tools Used:** Power BI | MySQL | DAX | Data Modeling  
- **Key Focus Areas:** Patient Visits | Treatment Costs | Doctor & Lab Performance  

---

## 🗂️ Dataset Description  
The dataset consists of multiple relational tables forming a star schema:  
- **Patients:** Patient demographics and registration details  
- **Doctors:** Doctor information, specialization, and experience  
- **Visits:** Visit details including date, diagnosis, and treatment costs  
- **LabTests:** Test type, result status, and lab cost data  

---

## ⚙️ Data Processing  
- Imported and cleaned raw data from **MySQL** into Power BI  
- Built relationships between tables (Patients, Doctors, Visits, LabTests)  
- Designed calculated columns and DAX measures for key performance metrics  
- Ensured consistent data formatting and integrity

## 📈 Dashboard Features  
- **KPI Cards:** Total Revenue, Avg Treatment Cost, Avg Lab Cost, Follow-Up Rate, Total Visits, Total Doctors, Total Patients, Total Lab Tests  
- **Filters & Slicers:** Visit Date, Diagnosis, Result Status, and City  
- **Visuals:**  
  - Patient Count by City  
  - Diagnosis Count by Diagnosis Type  
  - Total Lab Tests by Result Status  
  - Total Treatment Cost by Diagnosis  
- **Design:** Custom green theme, card shadows, slicers, and a clean, professional grid layout
